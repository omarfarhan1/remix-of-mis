    Instruction for the NEW Global Core Offer:
    - CRITICAL: Avoid broad, generic, or "marketing-fluff" phrases like "comprehensive retail package", "tailored solutions", or "one-stop shop".
    - BE SPECIFIC: Name the tangible products/services and the actual visceral outcome. (e.g. Instead of "retail package", use "Inventory tracking system that cuts beauty store shrinkage by 15%").
    - USE PROVEN HOOKS: Extract the highest-resonance psychological triggers found in the avatar offers.
    - STRUCTURE: Follow a direct, high-impact structure.
